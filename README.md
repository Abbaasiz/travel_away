# Deployment

- After deploying the `Services.html` page, there was an issue with some card images not displaying correctly. The process to resolve the issue involved deleting the problematic images from the media folder, renaming them in the gallery, and re-uploading them to the media directory. Once the image links were updated in the workspace, the card images displayed as intended.

- After deployment, the layout of the `Services.html` page was not displaying as expected. The issue was resolved by modifying the code in the `style.css` file, resulting in the page rendering correctly.
