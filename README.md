# Features
- Home/page:
For the Homepage we tested two different layouts on the wireframes. The first a=lay out the header was too packed. So we took out some of the text. After we took out some of the text the header appeared too empty. We realised that the Icon was too big in comparison to the space we have on the header. The icon was made smaller and two lines of text were added in the header. The Footer was at first sticky then it was changed where only the navbar appeared to be sticky. The page appeared visually pleasing for user experience.
- Destinations:
The destinations page was at first supposed to be a drop down that takes the user over to the link where they can view a different page. However, it was not possible due to lack of time. Therefore, we used a simpler code where when using the drop down link the user is able to select different destinations then the text would appear.
- Services:
On the services.html page we tested different wireframe layouts. We started with 2 rows of 3 images and a description of each service underneath. Which appeared too busy and not user friendly. Then decided that putting the images in circles would appear visually pleasing. However after testing the wireframe we realised that it would not be the best choice as we have 6 images on our page and the images can not be displayed larger due to lack of space for text. And when the images were made smaller it wasn’t visually pleasing and the layout was not user friendly or professional. Lastly the wireframe we created had 6 cards and the images were displayed in the card and under the image in the card the text description was added. Now to create better user experience we added a Modal with a READ MORE button where the user can click that to see the rest of the information instead of putting it all in the card as it won’t be user friendly.
- Booking:
The bookings page wireframe was created to provide an input interface for users to book a trip. The UX design includes an image and the form on the right for a pleasant user experience.  The booking now button has a hover effect to give the user a pleasant experience.  When a user submits the form, they are redirected to a confirmation page which shows a confirmation message and a button for them to return to the home page of Travel Away.

# Deployment

- After deploying the `Services.html` page, there was an issue with some card images not displaying correctly. The process to resolve the issue involved deleting the problematic images from the media folder, renaming them in the gallery, and re-uploading them to the media directory. Once the image links were updated in the workspace, the card images displayed as intended.

- After deployment, the layout of the `Services.html` page was not displaying as expected. The issue was resolved by modifying the code in the `style.css` file, resulting in the page rendering correctly.
